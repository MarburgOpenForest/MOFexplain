<h1>Views</h1>
<p>Views are used to get a defined subset and collection of data from different relations. All views are nemed with a prefix <code>vw_</code>.</p>
<div id="time-dependent-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Time dependent data</h3>
<p>For all time dependent data views on the actual dataset is implement to get a single 1:1 connection. For example the view on the <code>lut_tree_state</code> table:</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>CREATE VIEW vw_actual_tree_state AS
    SELECT id,tree_id,creator_id, max(date) AS date, state_id, remarks FROM tree_state
    GROUP BY tree_id;</code></pre>
<p>Following views are implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>vw_actual_tree_decomposition</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_dendroband<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_diameter</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_habitat<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_height</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_lyingdeadwood</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_roost</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_socialposition</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_state</li>
<li>vw_actual_tree_vitality</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>1</sup>Views with concatenated datafield.</p>

<h3>Plots</h3>
<p>The different types of plots are distinguished with various views. Following types of plots are implemented by now:</p>
<ul>
<li>forest structure - fs</li>
<li>exclosure experiments - exp</li>
<li>dendrometer band fields - dm</li>
<li>dendro-ecology - de</li>
<li>pasture structure - ps</li>
</ul>
<p>For example all general information for a forest structure plot is determined with:</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>CREATE VIEW &quot;vw_plot_fs&quot; AS
SELECT a.&quot;id&quot; AS &quot;id&quot;, a.&quot;plot_id&quot; AS &quot;plot_id&quot;, a.&quot;plottype_id&quot; AS &quot;plottype_id&quot;, a.&quot;creator_id&quot; AS &quot;creator_id&quot;, a.&quot;status&quot; AS &quot;status&quot;,
