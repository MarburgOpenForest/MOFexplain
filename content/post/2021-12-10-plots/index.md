# Survey Plots

### Forest Structure -- fs
Plots for surveying forest structure are setup by various student groups since 2017. The decision where to set up a plot follows no random or systematic scheme (what a pitty!) but is somehow accidental.

General characteristics are:
* circular 10m radius in horizontal plane
* slope
* aspect
* remarks on special items

All plots are marked with a central point (stored in `topopoint` (see figure \@ref(fig:benchmark-fig)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/benchmark.png" alt="Benchmark" width="644" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:benchmark-fig)Benchmark</p>
</div>

On the plot following items are surveyed depending on time:
* coordinates of all trees from 7 cm dbh
* species
* dbh
* optional
  * height
  * micro habitats
  * vitality
  * social position
  
A plot from data out of MOFgeoDB is shown in figure \@ref(fig:fs-plot-fig).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fs-004_plotExample.png" alt="Example of fs-plot" width="548" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:fs-plot-fig)fs-004 as example for the visualization of the plot data in QGIS.</p>
</div>
In real the plot looks something like this:
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fs-004_summerPano.jpg" alt="SUmmer pano of fs-004"  />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:fs-004-summerPano-fig)Panoramic view of fs-004 in summer.</p>
</div>



All plots are visited sporadically. The locations are shown in figure XXX
