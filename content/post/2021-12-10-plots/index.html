<h3>Forest Structure – fs</h3>
<p>Plots for surveying forest structure are setup by various student groups since 2017. The decision where to set up a plot follows no random or systematic scheme (what a pitty!) but is somehow accidential.</p>
<p>General characteristics are:
* circular 10m radius in horizontal plane
* slope
* aspect
* remarks on special items</p>
<p>All plots are marked with a central point (stored in <code>topopoint</code>, see fig x).</p>
<p>On the plot following items are surveyed depending on time:
* all trees from 7 cm dbh
* species
* dbh
* optional
* height
* micro habitats
* vitality
* social position</p>
<p>A plot from data out of MOFgeoDB is shown in fig. xx.</p>
<p>All plots are visited sporadically.</p>
