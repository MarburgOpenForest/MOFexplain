# Survey Plots

### Forest Structure -- fs
Plots for surveying forest structure are setup by various student groups since 2017. The decision where to set up a plot follows no random or systematic scheme (what a pitty!) but is somehow accidential.

General characteristics are:
* circular 10m radius in horizontal plane
* slope
* aspect
* remarks on special items

All plots are marked with a central point (stored in `topopoint`, see fig x). 

On the plot following items are surveyed depending on time:
* all trees from 7 cm dbh
* species
* dbh
* optional
  * height
  * micro habitats
  * vitality
  * social position
  
A plot from data out of MOFgeoDB is shown in fig. xx.

All plots are visited sporadically.
